# Questions to ask for the right data structure:
1. the size of the potential items\
2. do you know the maximum size in advance\
3. dynamic vs static (preallocate)
4. all the operations you need (insert, delete, update, search)\
5. do you need to keep the items in order\
6. the read/write (insert/delete) ratio\
7. access pattern (random vs unform), will the skewed access distribution be a concern
8. what storage medium for the data?  register, memory, hard drive, remote distributed network storage... etc\
