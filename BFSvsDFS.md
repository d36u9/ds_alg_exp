# Breadth First Search(BFS) vs. Depth First Search(DFS)

## Running Complexity
almost the same: O(V+E)

## Memory
BFS may use more mem, especially keep tracking the all traversed paths while searching.
DFS use less mem due to only keep tracking the related


## Data Structures for path tracking
BFS uses FIFO, like queue.
DFS uses FILO, like stack.

## common cases
BFS for shortest path
DFS for puzzle or slotion/path exploration.
