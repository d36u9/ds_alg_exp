# A simple description about the difference
Concurrency is like an infrastructure, or ability of a structure/mechanism to do things simutaneously.
Parallism is like a status of operating situtation, or an requirement of doing things simutaneously.

Let's take a inter-stae hight way as an example.
The highway itself is a concurrency infrastructure. 4 lanes or 8 lanes is the capacity.
Parallism is the status of highway, like, 4 cars are running on 4 different lanes.
However, 4 cars can also run sequentially on the same lane.

Concurrency is the capability, and how to utilize the capability becomes parallism.
